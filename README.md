## Description

<p>Have you heard of XKCD Comics? It is a collection of statements on life and love to mathematical, programming, and scientific in-jokes. Aaaaaaand they have an API for them! In the <b>XKCD API Challenge</b> we will build a bit more complex UI, with more options for the user than before.</p>

<p>We will cover different scenarios of requests - e.g. request a comic by ID, a random one, next, previous, first and last one existing, - all of that with the help of API calls!</p>

<p>The more you have little parts in the application, the more things you need to consider while building the interface and the logic behind it. This is a bit of a step-up comparing to the previous challenges, but nothing we cannot manage together.</p>

<p>Feel free to try out first yourself or jump on the YouTube video from the start, find what works best fo you and enjoy! üê£
